## Introductory Section

Hi there! My name is Lavanya Bhatia. I'm a senior at GWU, studying Marketing and International Business with a minor in Journalism. I'm an international student, currently situated in Dubai. 

I'm interested in Advertising, Media, and Marketing and hope to work at an ad agency after I graduate in May 2021. 

## Previous Work 

### Impeachment

This project analyzes various aspects of President Trump's impeachment data by looking at House Democrats and Republicans. This file shows both the working code and the results output. 

The file can be found [here](https://lavanyabhatia.github.io/impeachment/).

### Biden Transition

This project scraped the Biden Transition site and captured what was new, then generated a dynamic report that can be updated multiple times a day as necessary to share information on the status of the transition teams.

See it in action [here](https://lavanyabhatia.github.io/bidentransition/).


### Dashboard

This dashboard uses the data scraped from the Biden Transition site to create a presentation of the analysis and highlight the most important takeaways.
