## Introductory Section

Hi there! My name is Lavanya Bhatia. I'm a senior at GWU, studying Marketing and International Business with a minor in Journalism. I'm an international student, currently situated in Dubai. 

I'm interested in advertising, media, and marketing and hope to work at an ad agency after I graduate in May 2021. 

## Previous Work

### Biden Transition

This project scraped the Biden Transition site and captured what was new, then generated a dynamic report that can be updated multiple times a day as necessary to share information on the status of the transition teams.

See it in action [here](https://lavanyabhatia.github.io/bidentransition/).
