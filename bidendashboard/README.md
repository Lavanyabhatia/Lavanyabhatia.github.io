# gw_r_assignment_rscraping
GW data class assignment  

This assignment uses data scraped from the Biden transition website (https://buildbackbetter.gov). 

Instructions:  
  
- First step: "Fork" this github repository using the button on the upper right. As we discussed, this will create a new version of the files that are *yours* on your own Github account and that you can change, pull from and push to as you desire.  

- Second step: Once you have successfully "forked" this respository to your own account, you then want to "clone" it from RStudio (using the big green 'code' button to locate the necessary URL).  
  
- Once that is done, the assignment files to be completed can be found in files prefaced with 03_ and 04_). (Files with 01_ and 02_ reflect work we did together in the last class to build the scrapers, you can leave them alone for now.)   

- Assignment Part 1: Using the 03 file, "03_compare_current_with_previous.R", write your code to compare the current live WH staff list with the previously stored one located in the archived_data folder. You can use the filled-in version present in that file for Agency Review teams to help you.  
*Along the way, you must use git to "commit" your changes at least three times*
  
- Assignment Part 2: Using the 04 Rmarkdown file, "04_assignmentfile_markdownreport.Rmd", fill in the blank code chunks with your code designed to display the requested pieces of information. For this step, you should both figure out the necessary data slices to produce, as well as then format them for easy viewing using the table formatting package of your choice (kableExtra or gt). Note that completing this step will require both using Step 03's pre-existing code for agency review teams as well as your own new code to do the same for comparing WH senior staffers.  
*Along the way, you must use git to "commit" your changes at least three times*

- Final steps: when you have completed the assignment, ensure that you have "pushed" the final versions of your files back to github as part of your *forked* repository on your github account. Check your account online to ensure they've gone through. And remember, each file should have no less than three "commits" of your changes along the way as you were doing the work.  
Once that is done, copy and paste your repository url into the space provided with the assignment listed on Blackboard. This is all your need to submit through Blackboard itself, the url itself.
